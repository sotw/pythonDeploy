#### Install

##### For Windows
Just execute **32bit** version batch script. Don't bother with 64bits version.

#### How to use
After installed, your environment suppose to have a command python.
Just type python on command line to see what happen.
For example, in windows system, you type CMD enter console screen, type python to see what happen.

#### To do
1. Windows7/8 64bits basic function, need test. welcome volunteer
2. Linux pip setup for common use module, currently it means python modules, more specific "pip install"
3. MAC needs to use MAC port ( Strange... Somehow I don't want to use cygwin, but I want to use MAC port. I can't explain. )
